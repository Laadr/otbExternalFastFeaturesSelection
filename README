General
=======

This is a remote module for the ORFEO
Toolbox(https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/). It is designed to work with OTBv5
modular system and to be places in OTB/Module/Remote.

This module implements a method to perform a fast forward feature selection using a Gaussian Mixture Model. The algorithm is based on the following papers http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00857 and Nonlinear parsimonious feature selection for the classification of hyperspectral images (http://fauvel.mathieu.free.fr/pdfs/pgpda_grsl.pdf).

It is a fork of the ORFEO ToolBox template module provided by Manuel Grizonnet
(https://github.com/orfeotoolbox/otbExternalModuleTemplate.git) and which is itself a fork of the ITK template module provided by Bradley Lowekamp
(https://github.com/blowekamp/itkExternalTemplate.git) which was adapted for the
ORFEO ToolBox.
